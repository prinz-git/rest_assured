# API Testing Automation with Rest-Assured

## Overview

This repository showcases the implementation of API Testing Automation using **Rest-Assured**. Rest-Assured is a powerful Java library that simplifies the process of API testing by providing an easy-to-use interface for sending requests, validating responses, and performing various assertions.

This project is the result of my self-learning journey to understand and implement API testing automation using Rest-Assured. I have documented my learnings here, from writing simple test cases to performing end-to-end API testing automation.

I heard a lot about how **Rest-Assured** has simplified the life of QA engineers by automating repetitive tasks and making API testing more efficient. Inspired by this, I decided to explore and master the framework, and this repository contains example code that demonstrates how to perform various API testing tasks such as sending requests, validating responses, and working with authentication.

## Project Features

- **Basic API Testing:** Performing common assertions such as checking response status codes, response body content, and more.
- **Authentication:** Examples of token-based authentication and how to handle login and registration tests.
- **Number-Related Assertions:** Validating numerical data in API responses, including greater than, less than, and equality checks.
- **String Assertions:** Performing assertions to check the presence, starting, and ending of string data in responses.
- **TestNG Integration:** Utilizing the TestNG framework for organizing and running tests with data providers and configuration.

## Technologies Used

- **Rest-Assured:** For API testing and assertions.
- **TestNG:** For test organization, execution, and reporting.
- **Java:** As the programming language.
- **Maven:** For project management and dependency management.
